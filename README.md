# Extra targets

This repository contains function related targets which are handled outside the asset repository.

## Visemes

There are two sets of targets related to visemes:

- *visemes01*: microsoft style visemes
- *visemes02*: meta style visemes

As of 2026-01-15, these works per se. However, as they are autogenerated, they look a bit clunky.

## Faceunits

There is one set of faceunits so far: 

- *faceunits01*: Autogenerated ARKit face units
